# GenDisc
A Gender Discrimination based Cyberbullying Detection System in Under-resourced Bangla Language.In our proposed approach, we
used the XLM-RoBERTa model to train a gender-based discrimina-
tory text classifier. We demonstrated that integrating gender-based
discrimination variables improve a classifierâ€™s capacity to discrim-
inate against cyberbullying. Our evaluations yield up to a 79.6
Area-Under-the-Curve score for Precision-Recall and an Accuracy
of 68% in gender-based speech detection during cross-validation
tests.
